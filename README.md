# **Development process**
Sprint length is determined as one week. All requirements have their own or multiple issues in the backlog.
Labels are used to associate a weight to the issues using the MOSCOW priority method.
Each sprint is marked with a milestone, and issues are associated with this milestone to keep track of the progress.
Issues are supplemented with checklists and labels
