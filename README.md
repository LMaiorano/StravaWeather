# Team Agreements:
### Definition of done: A feature is complete when:
1. Unittest complete
2. Code review complete (done by one other team member)
3. Local merge with 'other' branch 
4. Integration test complete
5. Remote (Gitlab) merge with 'other' branch
6. Merge Request Approved

*NB: 'other' = branch with which to integrate features; may be Development or other feature branch

### Agenda
The review and rectrospective of each sprint will be during our weekly labsession on Wednesday starting at 15.45. 

### Sprint rules
* The meetings on wednesday are used for sprint review, retrospective and planning
* Issue priority is set according to requirements priority
* Issue weight is used to set sprint points
* Each feature is developed on its own branch, which is merged with de development branch after the feature is done


### Development process
Sprint length is determined as one week. All requirements have their own or multiple issues in the backlog.
Labels are used to associate a weight to the issues using the MOSCOW priority method.
Each sprint is marked with a milestone, and issues are associated with this milestone to keep track of the progress.
Issues are supplemented with checklists and labels
