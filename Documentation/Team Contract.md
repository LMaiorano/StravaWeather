2. Code review complete (done by one other team member)
3. Local merge with 'other' branch 
4. Integration test complete
5. Remote (Gitlab) merge with 'other' branch
6. Merge Request Approved

*NB: 'other' = branch with which to integrate features; may be Development or other feature branch

### Agenda
The review and rectrospective of each sprint will be during our weekly labsession on Wednesday starting at 15.45. 

### Sprint rules
* The meetings on wednesday are used for sprint review, retrospective and planning
* Issue priority is set according to requirements priority
* Issue weight is used to set sprint points
* Each feature is developed on its own branch, which is merged with de development branch after the feature is done


### Development process
Sprint length is determined as one week. All requirements have their own or multiple issues in the backlog.
Labels are used to associate a weight to the issues using the MOSCOW priority method.
Each sprint is marked with a milestone, and issues are associated with this milestone to keep track of the progress.
Issues are supplemented with checklists and labels

*   Issues will be assigned to team members via GitLab.
*   The group must be notified in advance if a team member does not reach a deadline.
*   Missed deadlines without valid reason count as "Late".
