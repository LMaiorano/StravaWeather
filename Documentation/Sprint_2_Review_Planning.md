Sprint finished, all issues closed.
'Time spent' was not really used, should do in the next one, to keep track of who does what.
Burndown graph looks nice, should keep that up.
Development plan has a clear diagram. Which makes that everyone has clear what has to be done

Per module what we'd like to see in the coming week
First visualization then analysis: so one can check whether the data is true.
Strava and weather modules are very important otherwise we have no data
Jan has a nice KNMI github, which we can use
We should credit him and use his module.
This makes scraping weather easy. The Strava API should be able to be used easily, once you get into it.
We have a total of around 4 weeks of implementation starting now.
In the next sprint we should also start thinking / working on what to do with the midterm presentation

Visualization should be done in 2 hours.
Goal for Strava and Weather module: you run it and have a sample dataset.
So we can use these datasets for the Analyis module.
Write a function for the weather score.

sample outputs, could be created manually as long as they are in the same format as the module puts out later on
Jasper'd like to work with the Strava API --> Obtain Data with Strava API
Jasper also secretely started creating a skeleton

In this Sprint (milestone):
Julius & Ingmar on weather-module.
Pieter & Jasper on Strava-module
Luigi on heatmap.
