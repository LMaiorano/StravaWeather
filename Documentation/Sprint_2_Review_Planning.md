**Sprint 2**

Sprint finished, all issues closed.
'Time spent' was not really used, should do in the next one, to keep track of who does what.
Burndown graph looks nice, should keep that up.
Development plan has a clear diagram. Which makes that everyone has clear what 
has to be done

** Sprint 3 Planning **
In the coming weeks:
First implement Visualization-module then the Analysis-module: so one can check 
whether the data is true.
But for this sprint the Strava-module and Weather-module are important to start
implementing, to get data to be analyzed.
For the Weather-module, we can use "Jan's GitHub", he has implemented a KNMI
module, which should make scraping the website a lot easier.
When using we should credit him
The Strava API should be able to be used easily, once you get into it.
We have a total of around 4 weeks of implementation starting now.
In the next sprint we should also start thinking / working on what to do with 
the midterm presentation.
Visualization should be done in 2 hours.
This sprint we'd like to have sample datasets for the Strava- and
Weather-module, so we can start the Analysis-module in the next sprint.
Write a function for the weather score.

** In Sprint 3 (milestone): **
- Julius & Ingmar on weather-module.
- Pieter & Jasper on Strava-module
- Luigi on heatmap.
