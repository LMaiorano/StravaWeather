**Build a baseline**
Once, there needs to be built a baseline. This baseline can be an average over 
a period of, for instance, 2 years. This baseline will be used as a reference.

**Compare segments with baseline**
When there is a baseline, we can compare our data with the baseline. 
For each segment, we are defining how many people are cycling on that segment, 
with respect to the baseline.
We do this over a given period (this is an input variable), this same period is
also used for defining the weather scores of this period.

**Get days with certain weather score**
Within our period, we pick a weather score. 
This can either be a total score, or one of it's components.
Currently we think of the weather score containing: rain, wind, sunhours,
frost (optional) and a total score. 
The total score will be the result of a calculation of the the other parameters,
which has yet to be defined.

**Calculate average heatmaps**
For each weather score, we calculate an average heatmap.
When they are calculated, we can compare the average heatmaps of each
weather score with oneanother.
