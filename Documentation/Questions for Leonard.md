**1**

When are the deadlines for dev plan, design plan etc?

dev plan should be discussed in meeting and updated, then sent again.

Design plan has no strict deadline but should be handed in on december 1st


**2**

When is the midterm presentation?

Lab sessions in that week. group presentation


**3**

Is the current dev plan final, or can we make changes before the grading? Or, when is the grading done?

dev plan is not final, should be updated throughout the course

**4**

Storage of data: are we allowed to store data, and if so, which format/style should we use?

Own decision, storage space vs speed, format is also up to us. If we want we could implement our own algorithm

**5**

Is the design plan actually a architecture design plan?

yes

**6**

Are there any requirements for the design plan?

Own interpretation. Flowchart and in-/outputs are great.


**7**

The output of the analysis are heat maps, can we use a visual inspection, or should that be done by computer?



**8**

Grading

if stuck to dev and design plan. Presentation skills. If not kept to dev plan, discuss with TA and change dev plan.
20% for dev/design plan is not all about the plan, but how well the implementation follows the plan.

Implementation is not important for grading, because not all students are equally well at coding
Implementation has influence on design plan, so still important

**9**

What should we do for design validation?


**10**

We want to use heat maps for analysis validation, is dat okay?
