**Overall**

#Implementation

Even though we believe we started with a very thorough Development Plan, some changes were necessary.
For example, the module that scrapes the data from the Strava website took much longer than expected,
which resulted in a very short time left to finish the actual data analysis and results validation.
Also, we did not anticipate that there would be such a huge amount of data available on Strava.
Because of this, in combination with the severe limitations posed by the Strava API, we decided to limit our scope to Zuid-Holland instead.
