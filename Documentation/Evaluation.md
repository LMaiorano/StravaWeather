In this document, we will present our evaluation of this Computer Science Project.
To make sure that we covered all points, the evaluation is split in several parts.
First, the team work is evaluated, after which the implementation process is covered. Lastly, we reflect on the project as a whole.

**Team Work**

In Q1 of the Computer Science Minor we already worked together in the Software Engineering Methods project.
During that project, we already worked together very well as a team.
At the beginning of this project, we then decided to keep going the way we had before, since it worked out very well.
With the end of this project, we all feel that we have become an even better team, since we all know much more about each other.
Especially communication really improved. During the previous project, team members did not always really know what the others were working.
This project however, all team members really felt more engaged in the project and knew what the other team members were up to.

**Implementation**

In comparison to the previous project, the  because there was a clear Design Plan from the beginning


Even though we believe we started with a very thorough Development Plan, some changes were necessary.
For example, the module that scrapes the data from the Strava website took much longer than expected,
which resulted in a very short time left to finish the actual data analysis and results validation.
Also, we did not anticipate that there would be such a huge amount of data available on Strava.
Because of this, in combination with the severe limitations posed by the Strava API, we decided to limit our scope to Zuid-Holland instead.


**Overall**
